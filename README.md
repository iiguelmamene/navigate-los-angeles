# navigate-los-angeles
This project is a navigation system that gives turn-by-turn directions from a start to finish location in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

This project utilizes the A* (A star) search algorithm to determine the ideal path from one point in Westwood to another. A text file of Westwood geographical information serves as the basis for the "map" in this project.
